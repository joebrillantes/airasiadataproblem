### Task 1
The website traffic increased by around 13%, but the total number of searches have dramatically gone down, where almost 25% of the search volume has been lost. It has been concluded that there is a surge in traffic that is interested in using the self-service products, which is very positive since the self-service products have been heavily marketed. Further, the traffic the website is getting is less interested in booking, or at least in searching to see the fares. Unfortunately, there is no search data before Sep 2014. Thus, it is hard to determine if the number of searches has been decreasing.
